	<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
	<p>This project aims to develop an API for providing a well defined way of starting and stopping the Baxter as well as switching between demos on it. The API is extensible for adding new demos and can be used with different user interfaces(e.g keyboard, graphic user interface). 
	</p> 

	<p>The video shows the Baxter running several demos provided by Rethink Robotics with keyboard. The code is implemented in Python. Some of the necessary and relevant ROS packages and libraries are following: 
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>SMACH</li>
		<li>actionlib</li>
		<li>bondpy</li>
		<li>subprocess</li>
		
	</ul>

	<p>Python code and more detail about project can be found on this <a href = "https://github.com/elmuhn/baxter_demo_manager.git">page</a>.
